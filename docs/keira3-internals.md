# Keira3 Internals

This is a collection of notes aiming to explain the internals of Keira3 for development purposes.

If you just want to use Keira3, you don't need any of the following. If you want to modify Keira3, for example to improve it or to add new features, you may find this page useful.

## Main technologies

Keira3 is built upon the following open source web technologies:

- [**TypeScript**](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is the main language of Keira3. It is a superset of JavaScript. 
If you know JavaScript and have some basic knowledge of OOP languages like Java and C#, you will feel pretty familiar with TypeScript already.
Otherwise you might find [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) helpful.
If you don't know JavaScript at all, it would be better to get some basic knowledge first.

- [**Angular**](https://angular.io/). This is the main framework behind Keira3. 
We absolutely recommend to get familiar with it before getting your hands inside Keira3's code.
If you are looking for a complete Angular course, we can recommend [this one](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).

- We use [**SCSS**](https://sass-lang.com/) to style our UI. It's an extension of CSS.
Knowing the CSS fundamentals is required in order to be able to change the Keira3's interface.
SCSS should be quite intuitive for anyone who can understand CSS.

- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the CSS framework used as a base for Keira3's style.
You don't have to be a Bootstrap expert, however we recommend to be at least familiar with its [Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/) and Utilities like [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/spacing/).

- [**Electron**](https://electronjs.org/) is the software framework that allows building Desktop apps using web technologies.
We don't use many native Electron features so usually you don't have to worry about it when developing Keira3.
